            What people tell us about services helps us build a picture of the standard of care they give.

        <gds-paragraph>
            One of our inspectors will look at the information you've given us. How they use it will depend on what you've said. If your concerns are serious we'll take action, like contacting or visiting the service.
        </gds-paragraph>
        <gds-paragraph>
            We'll email you in the next 5 days to tell you when we've passed your information to an inspector.
